# WebApp_InJava_UNIL

In this repository, I am excited to showcase a Java web application that I developed from scratch using Apache NetBeans IDE. This application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and incorporates database functionality to provide a comprehensive solution. I achieved a notable grade of 5,5/6.

## Project Overview
The Java web application is designed to offer budget management capabilities to users. It allows individuals to input their budget data, which then generates an analysis of their portfolio.

### Key Features

- User Authentication: The application includes a user authentication system to ensure secure access to budget management functionalities.
- Budget Input: Users can input their budget details, including income, expenses, savings, and investment data.
- Portfolio Analysis: Based on the provided budget data, the application generates an analysis of the user's portfolio, offering insights into spending habits, savings goals, investment performance, and more.
- Database Integration: The application utilizes a database backend to store and manage user data securely.
- MVC Architecture: Following the MVC design pattern ensures a clear separation of concerns and facilitates maintainability and scalability of the application codebase.

### Technologies Used

- Java: Core programming language for application development.

- Apache NetBeans IDE: Integrated development environment used for Java development, offering convenient tools and features for building web applications.

- Database Management System: Integration with a database management system to handle data storage and retrieval efficiently.

## Conclusion
Creating this Java web application was an enriching experience, allowing me to apply my Java programming skills and understanding of web development concepts. The project demonstrates my proficiency in building robust, database-driven web applications using Java technologies.
